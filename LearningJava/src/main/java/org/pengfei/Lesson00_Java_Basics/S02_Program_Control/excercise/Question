1. Write a program that reads characters from the keyboard until a period is received. Have the program count the
   number of spaces. Report the total at the end of the program.

2. Show the general form of the if­else­if ladder.

3. Given
if(x<10)
  if(y>100){
    if(!done) x=z;
    else y=z;
}
else System.out.println("error"); //what if
to what if does the last else associate?

4. Show the for statement for a loop that counts from 1000 to 0 by -2.

5. Is the following fragment valid?
for(int i=0; i<50;i++)
  sum+=i;

count =i;

6. Explain what break does. Be sure to explain both of its forms.

7. In the following fragment, after the break statement executes, what is displayed?
for(i=0;i<10;i++) {
  while(running){
    if(x<y) break;
    ...
    }
    System.out.println("after while");
}
System.out.println("after for");
}

8. What does the following fragment print?
  for(int i=0; i<10;i++){
            System.out.print(i+ " ");
            if((i%2)==0) continue;
            // If continue is called, all statement after continue are not executed, the loop start over with the next index
            System.out.println(" ");
        }

9. The iteration expression in a for loop need not always alter the loop control variable by a fixed amount. Instead,
   the loop control variable can change in any arbitrary way. Using this concept, write a program that uses a for loop
   to generate and display the progression 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on.

10. The ASCII lowercase letters are separated from the uppercase letters by 32. Thus, to convert a lowercase letter to
    uppercase, subtract 32 from it. Use this information to write a program that reads characters from the keyboard.
    Have it convert all lowercase letters to uppercase, and all uppercase letters to lowercase, displaying the result.
    Make no changes to any other character. Have the program stop when the user enters a period. At the end, have the
    program display the number of case changes that have taken place.

11. What is an infinite loop?

12. When using break with a label, must the label be on a block that contains the break?
