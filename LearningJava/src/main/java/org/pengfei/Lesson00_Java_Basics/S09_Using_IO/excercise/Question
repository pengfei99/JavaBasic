1. Why does Java define both byte and character streams?

2. Even though console input and output is text­based, why does Java still use byte streams for this purpose?

3. Show how to open a file for reading bytes.

4. Show how to open a file for reading characters.

5. Show how to open a file for random­access I/O.

6. How do you convert a numeric string such as "123.23" into its binary equivalent?

7. Write a program that copies a text file. In the process, have it convert all spaces into hyphens. Use the byte
   stream file classes. Use the traditional approach to closing a file by explicitly calling close().

8. Rewrite the program in question 7 so that it uses the character stream classes. This time, use the
   try­with­resources statement to automatically close the file.

9. What type of stream is System.in?

10. What does the read() method of InputStream return when an attempt is made to read at the end of the stream?

11. What type of stream is used to read binary data?

12. Reader and Writer are at the top of the ____________ class hierarchies.

13. The try­with­resources statement is used for ___________ ____________ ____________.

14. If you are using the traditional method of closing a file, then closing a file within a finally block is generally
    a good approach. True or False?

15. Can local variable type inference be used when declaring the resource in a try­with­resources statement?
